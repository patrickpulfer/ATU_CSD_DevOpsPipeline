# Smart Help Desk System

This project aims to develop a smarter Help Desk online system to improve the end-user experience,
lower costs in human resources and improve metrics like Time to Resolution (TTR). The system will
automate troubleshooting steps to gather diagnostic data, make this data available for the Help Desk
engineer and suggest possible solutions proactively.
